# Metaincognita Guidelines

**The standard for every simulator in the Metaincognita casino suite.**
Version: **1.2** · Status: living document · canonical home: `metaincognita-blackjack/docs/` (move to the
metaincognita.com umbrella repo when it exists) · Last revised: 2026-07-14

> **v1.2 (2026-07-14):** the umbrella site is no longer hypothetical — **metaincognita.com** is live (`metaincognita-default`), built as a floor with a cabinet per game. Added **the hub exit** (§5): every simulator carries a gold `METAINCOGNITA` wordmark in the top bar that leaves the app for the hub, on every route, never hidden and never confirmed. Canonical in **slots** (§8). Recorded **blackjack** as the one pending adopter.

> **v1.1 (2026-06-13):** added the render-verification discipline (§4 — browser-smoke every UI phase; test display logic against *real* engine output, never hand-made fixtures); added slot-machine visual conventions (§5) and **slots** as a canonical reference (§2.4, §8); recorded `app/engine/` as an accepted engine path (§3).

Metaincognita is a family of single-player casino simulators — Hold'em, Video Poker, Flameout,
Craps, Pachinko, Slots, Blackjack, and whatever comes next — built so that learning the real
mathematics of a gambling game is more fun than gambling. Every app must **look, work, teach,
explain, and help players learn the same way**. A player who knows one simulator should feel at
home in all of them; a developer who has read one codebase should be able to navigate any other.
The long-term destination is **metaincognita.com**: one site, one visual language, one teaching
methodology, many games.

This document is the canon. Where it names a game in *(parentheses)*, that repo is the
**canonical reference implementation** — copy from it rather than reinventing.

## 1. The Five Commitments

1. **Authentic.** Rules, procedures, pay tables, and odds come from primary sources — gaming
   commission regulations, casino rulebooks, manufacturer documents — committed to `docs/` and
   cited inline in the engine *(blackjack: three commission rulebooks cited per-section in
   engine comments; craps: Marina Bay Sands government-approved rules)*.
2. **Learning-centered.** The point is not to play; it is to understand. Every simulator ships
   the full learning scaffold (§2) and the training formula (§2.3).
3. **Local-only, money-free.** No real wagering, no accounts, no server play, no analytics,
   no external runtime calls. Every README carries the standard disclaimer blockquote
   *(craps wrote it first)*. Bankrolls are fictitious and the apps say so in the footer.
4. **Honest fun.** Personality is welcome — bot companions, stickman calls, pit-boss lines —
   but flavor never lies about math. Myths are presented *as myths*, with the refutation
   *(blackjack's Myths tab; craps' gambler's-fallacy warnings)*. All flair sits behind a
   "minimal flair" toggle and respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
5. **Identical chrome, custom felt.** The UI shell — status bars, navigation, history,
   analysis, learn, settings patterns — is the same in every app. Only the game area (table,
   machine, board) is custom. This is the founding principle of the family design system
   *(video-poker `docs/design-system.md`)*.

---

## 2. The Learning Scaffold (required in every simulator)

Every Metaincognita app teaches on five layers. The first four are required; the Lab (§2.5)
is the standard to grow into.

### 2.1 The README is a textbook chapter

The README is not packaging; it is the first learning surface, and often the only one a
GitHub visitor sees. **Every README must contain a learning section** with:

- **An accurate history of the game** — a real essay with dates, named people, and primary
  events, written in plain prose. Contested lore is flagged as lore, never laundered into
  fact *(flameout's "A Brief History of Crash Games" — eleven subsections from the 2014
  Bitcointalk origin to today — is the depth bar; pachinko's "About Pachinko" shows the
  cultural-history register; blackjack's "Learn the Game" shows the contested-etymology
  handling)*.
- **Tidbits** — short, true, surprising facts that reward the curious reader.
- **Variations** — the named variants a player will actually meet, each with its twist and
  its catch (what the flashy rule costs).
- **The mathematics** where the game warrants it inline *(flameout's "The Mathematics of
  Crash Games" with distribution, EV proof, variance, and betting-system debunking)*.

Deep research belongs in `docs/` as appendices the essay draws from *(pachinko's
`docs/appendix-a-history.md` research-notes-to-essay pipeline)*.

### 2.2 The in-app `/learn` page

The same knowledge, restructured for in-app reading: game math, how-to-play, **history**
(condensed era cards), myths vs reality, procedure/etiquette, and a glossary
*(flameout `app/pages/learn.vue` — sidebar-section structure; blackjack `learn.vue` —
tabbed structure with an engine-generated strategy chart and a live rules lab)*. Wherever
possible the learn page computes from the engine rather than hardcoding — charts, edges, and
pay tables must be the same objects the game plays with *(blackjack's `generateChart` chart
and house-edge rules lab)*.

### 2.3 The training formula

The interactive teaching loop, identical across the suite:

> **real-time advisor → per-decision EV feedback → outcome explanation → history →
> analysis → learn → drills**

- **Advisor**: ranked or recommended actions with EV numbers, before the player acts
  *(craps' ranked bet advisor; blackjack's coach/feedback/exam intensities)*.
- **Per-decision feedback**: every player decision graded against optimal play with the
  cost in money, recorded — not just shown *(blackjack `DecisionRecord`; video poker's
  per-hold EV analysis)*.
- **Outcome explanation**: when a round settles, say what happened, why, and what it cost
  or paid, where the player's eyes already are *(blackjack's center-felt banner + advisor
  round recap)*.
- **History**: a complete, persisted log of rounds and graded decisions.
- **Analysis**: adherence percentages, top repeated mistakes, expectation vs variance
  ("EV lost vs actual P&L"), bankroll curve *(craps' distribution charts; blackjack's
  adherence-by-category)*.
- **Drills**: dedicated practice reps for the game's core skills, seeded by the player's
  own recorded mistakes *(blackjack's mistake-weighted Strategy Flash)*.

### 2.4 The accuracy bar

- Primary sources committed to `docs/` and cited where used.
- Engine-computed numbers are **verified by statistical simulation** against theory
  (≥100k seeded rounds within ~3–3.5σ) *(blackjack's 200k-round suite; craps' convergence
  tests; flameout's EV proofs; slots' 5M-cycle floor verify at 3.5σ over the full exact-
  enumeration cycle)* and **pinned against canonical published references**
  cell-for-cell where they exist *(blackjack's basic-strategy chart pins; slots' frozen
  per-machine RTP/HF values reproduced bit-for-bit in tests)*.
- When a model is an estimate, the UI says so *(blackjack's "house edge is a model
  estimate" footnote)*.

### 2.5 The Lab — the experimentation surface

Where the learn page explains and the drills build reflexes, **the Lab lets the player run
experiments**. It is the suite's answer to "what would happen if…?" — and it must answer with
the real engine, never a lookup table.

A Lab is a dedicated page where the player can:

- **Parameterize a strategy.** Whatever the game's levers are: a bet ramp by true count
  (blackjack), odds multiples and bet mixes (craps), hold strategies (video poker), cash-out
  targets (flameout).
- **See the math instantly.** Closed-form expectation, variance, hands-to-overcome-variance
  (N0), and risk of ruin update live as sliders move — every figure labeled as model or
  measurement.
- **Run the experiment headlessly.** One button plays thousands of games — e.g., 5,000 rounds
  or 500 full bankroll lifetimes — through the *actual game engine* at optimal (or the
  player's configured) strategy, in a web worker with progress, and reports the empirical
  distribution: bankroll fan charts (p5/p25/p50/p75/p95), ruin rates, convergence toward the
  theoretical edge. The point is visceral: variance is loud, expectation is quiet, and only
  volume tells the truth.
- **Optionally feed play.** A Lab configuration may plug back into the table as opt-in
  coaching (blackjack's ramp bet hints) — always off by default, never visible to a player
  who just wants to sit down and play.

The Lab is the same machinery as the §2.4 simulation proofs, pointed at the player instead of
CI. *(Canonical: blackjack's Bet-Ramp & Risk-of-Ruin Lab; ancestors: craps' auto-roll/rapid
convergence mode, video poker's async EV analysis workers, flameout's distribution
simulators.)*

## 3. Methodology — how a simulator gets built

1. **Sources first.** Collect the primary documents into `docs/`; choose the named rule
   presets the app will ship.
2. **Spec, then plan.** Brainstorm to a written design spec in `docs/superpowers/specs/`;
   derive implementation plans with complete code; execute task-by-task with per-task review
   *(blackjack's three-plan history is the template)*.
3. **Engine before UI.** A pure-TypeScript, framework-free engine under `app/engine/` or
   `app/utils/engine/` (or `app/utils/` for simpler games) — TDD throughout,
   simulation-verified before a single component exists.
4. **Game UI second.** Setup screen → playable table → persistence. The casino-procedure vs
   quick-play toggle is **purely presentational** — pacing must never change engine behavior.
5. **Trainer surfaces third.** Advisor, feedback, history, analysis, learn, drills.
6. **Hardening last.** Mobile pass, accessibility pass (axe-clean AA), Playwright E2E,
   deploy config, release notes.

## 4. Code theory — the architecture every repo follows

- **Engine purity.** Nothing under the engine directory imports Vue, Nuxt, or Pinia. The
  engine is unit-testable in Node and could be re-skinned without modification. CI greps
  for violations.
- **Event-driven rounds.** The engine is a synchronous phase machine that **emits typed
  events**; the UI drains them through a pacing queue into *presented state*. Amounts and
  legality always read from engine state; visibility (what cards the player has "seen")
  always reads from presented state — so paced dealing can never leak hidden information
  *(blackjack `useGameLoop` is the canonical implementation)*.
- **Seeded randomness.** All shuffles/rolls flow through one injectable PRNG (mulberry32,
  crypto-seeded in live play, fixed-seeded in tests and simulations). Anything random must
  be reproducible *(flameout's provably-fair system is the maximal version)*.
- **Money is integer cents.** No floats in wagers, payouts, or bankrolls; payout rounding
  follows the cited rulebook.
- **Versioned persistence.** One `<game>-session-v1` localStorage key with a version field,
  validation + sanitize on load, corrupt → clean reset, quota failure → in-memory session
  with a visible warning. Mid-round refresh restores the exact state. **Lifetime learning
  stats live under their own key** and survive "leave table" *(blackjack's
  `blackjack-training-v1`)*.
- **Computed, not transcribed.** Where feasible, strategy charts, edges, and distributions
  are derived by the engine and *pinned* against published references in tests — the app
  must be able to explain its own numbers.
- **Trust engine output, not fixtures.** Test display/summary logic against the engine's
  *actual* emitted shapes, not hand-constructed inputs — a convenient fixture can encode the
  wrong assumption about a field and pass green while production is wrong *(slots: a win
  summary read `symbols.length` as the match count, but the line evaluator fills the whole
  payline, so a 3-of-a-kind rendered as "5 Aces" and highlighted non-winning cells; the
  hand-made test rows had hidden it)*.
- **Quality gates.** `test` (unit + component), `lint`, `typecheck` green before every
  commit; Playwright E2E for the money paths; axe-clean WCAG 2.1 AA on every user route.
  **Green unit tests do not prove the app renders.** Finish every UI phase with a live
  **browser smoke** — drive the real app, watch the console, inspect the rendered DOM (and
  for slot/grid surfaces, confirm the highlighted result matches the engine's scored outcome
  cell-for-cell). Nuxt auto-import and runtime wiring fail *silently* in SFC-import unit
  tests *(slots: `resolveComponent` inside a computed blanked every reel surface while 240+
  tests stayed green; the same smoke later caught the fixture bug above)*.
- **Conventional commits, no AI attribution trailers.** Semver + Keep-a-Changelog.

## 5. UI standard

The visual authority is **`metaincognita-video-poker/docs/design-system.md`** — stack, color
system, typography, layout, and component patterns. Summary of the non-negotiables:

- **Stack**: Nuxt 4 · Vue 3 · Nuxt UI 4 · Tailwind 4 · Pinia · TypeScript · pnpm · Vitest
  (unit/nuxt projects) · Playwright · Netlify static. Dark mode only.
- **Chrome** (identical everywhere): slim top status bar — **the hub exit pinned to its far
  left**, then back/leave + session stat — and a bottom bar with page navigation
  (History · Analysis · Learn · Drills), version string, and GitHub link; "leave" always
  confirms before destroying a session.
- **The hub exit** (`AppHubLink`, canonical in **slots**): a gold `METAINCOGNITA` wordmark
  linking to `https://metaincognita.com` — the floor every game hangs off. Nine games hung off
  that hub for months and not one of them linked home; a player deep in a cabinet had no way
  out but the browser's back button. The rules:
  - a **real `<a href>`**, never a router push — it leaves the SPA;
  - **same tab**, no `target="_blank"` — this is an *exit*, not a side trip;
  - on **every route, including the app's own index**. It is never gated, and it never hides;
  - it **never confirms**. It destroys nothing, and a player must *always* be able to leave.
    Do not confuse it with **back/leave**, which stays exactly as it is and — where it really
    does destroy a session — keeps its confirm. The hub exit is not a leave; it is the door.
  - it stays **gold in every app** even where the game accent is not. This is suite chrome,
    not game chrome: a player learns it once and finds it everywhere.
  - its accessible name must **contain the visible wordmark verbatim** —
    `aria-label="METAINCOGNITA — exit the simulator, back to all the games"`. "Meta Incognita"
    reads fine and fails WCAG 2.5.3 (Label in Name) on the space.

  *Pending adopter: **blackjack**, whose chrome is frozen by owner rule. Every other app on the
  hub has it. This is the one place the suite knowingly contradicts this document.*
- **Typography**: Fira Code (or system mono) for every number, count, and EV; system-ui for
  prose. If a number matters, it is monospaced.
- **Per-game accent** via `app.config.ts` `primary`; table games additionally use the shared
  casino-luxury tokens — felt `#0a5c36`, walnut rail, gold `#d4a847`, cream `#f5f0e1`, the
  chip palette *(holdem `main.css` is the origin; blackjack consumes the same block)*.
- **Keyboard play** end-to-end with visible hints on the buttons *(blackjack: H/S/D/P/R,
  B rebet, Space deal, C count-check)*.
- **Study mode**: pause the game, expose hotspots/tooltips that explain every zone with its
  edge *(craps invented it; blackjack's felt hotspots follow)*.
- **Accessibility**: aria-live announcements for everything a dealer would say, full
  keyboard operability with managed focus, axe-clean AA contrast (muted text floor:
  `neutral-400` on dark surfaces), `prefers-reduced-motion` globally disarms animation.
- **Mobile**: the game stays playable at 390px; secondary actors collapse to status chips
  *(blackjack's bot-chips strip)*.
- **Slot/machine games** have their own machine-face conventions, canonical in **slots**:
  pictorial symbol icons from a shared filled-duotone registry (royals/bars/sevens as styled
  type, never raw codes); reels that actually spin (vertical scroll, staggered ease-out stop,
  motion-blur, instant snap under `prefers-reduced-motion`); winning paylines **drawn across
  the face** with glowing cells and left-gutter line numbers; a result that **holds until the
  next spin** (gross win + current bankroll + literal per-line chips + a bankroll sparkline);
  and a lit per-machine marquee (game name + theme emblem). Credits always show beside real
  dollars with a denomination tag, so the credits↔money sleight is never hidden.

## 6. Brand & social assets

- **og-image**: every app commits `public/og-image.svg` *and* the rendered
  `public/og-image.png` (1200×630). The image uses the **branded background system**
  (design-system.md §"Hero Image"): navy diagonal gradient `#0a0c1a→#060810`, fine 20px
  grid `#1e2848`, major 100px grid `#283458`, dot overlay, radial vignette, corner
  registration marks, bottom rule at y=600 with the letterspaced `METAINCOGNITA` wordmark,
  and a 4px game-accent bar — then a game-specific content layer (cards, dice, machine) and
  the game title in the accent color with a glow. Render with
  `rsvg-convert -w 1200 -h 630 public/og-image.svg -o public/og-image.png`.
  **librsvg does not support `<textPath>`** — keep SVG sources textPath-free so the SVG and
  PNG match. *(video-poker `hero.svg` defined the system; blackjack `og-image.svg` is the
  newest conforming example.)*
- **Social meta**: `og:title/description/image(+width/height)/type` and
  `twitter:card=summary_large_image` wired in `nuxt.config.ts` *(holdem first; blackjack
  current)*.
- **README hero**: the og image, centered at top, before the H1
  *(video-poker's `<p align="center">` pattern)*.
- **Badges** (standard set, static shields.io, bumped at release — introduced by blackjack):
  `version` (gold `d4a847`), `tests` (count, green `16a34a`), `playwright` (spec count),
  `nuxt-4` (`00dc82`), `typescript-strict` (`3178c6`), `WCAG 2.1 AA` (`1f6feb`). Add a CI
  badge only when real CI exists — never a decorative one.

## 9. New-simulator checklist

1. Clone the craps skeleton; port holdem `main.css` tokens if it's a table game.
2. Collect primary rule sources into `docs/`; pick the cited presets.
3. Spec (`docs/superpowers/specs/`) → plans → engine TDD → simulation proof.
4. Game UI → persistence (versioned key + mid-round restore) → training formula surfaces.
5. Learning scaffold: README essay + tidbits + variations; `/learn` page with history tab.
6. Mobile, a11y (axe AA), Playwright E2E, Netlify deploy with the family CSP.
7. og-image SVG+PNG, social meta, README hero + badges.
8. Add the game to every sibling README's family footer.

*Questions this document doesn't answer get answered by reading the canonical repo for that
area — and then by amending this document, so the next game doesn't have to ask.*
